# etch-a-sketch

A browser-based sketchpad built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS — inspired by the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy. Move your mouse over the grid to draw!

## 🔧 Features

- 16x16 grid generated with JavaScript (not hardcoded!)
- Hover effect that changes square color (like drawing)
- Button to generate a new grid

## 📚 What I Learned

- Creating and modifying DOM elements dynamically
- Using event listeners for interactivity (hover effects)
- Flexbox layout for grid-like structure (without CSS Grid)
- Taking user input and validating it with JavaScript
- Writing clean, modular JS code and using Git effectively

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone this repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Hover over the grid to draw
4. Click “New Grid” to change the size

## 🛠 Tech Used
